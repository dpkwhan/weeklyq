## Answer
Here is the simple solution.

```q
fixMsg:"35=D|22=RIC|48=MS.N|54=1|44=33.85|53=500|30=XNYS";
parseFixMsg:{[msg](!)."S=|"0:msg};
parseFixMsg fixMsg
```

An acute reader might notice that the dictionary values are a string. To cast the values to proper types, some further work is required. Fortunately a nice solution is provided by one of Kx Systems' white papers.
