## Introduction
The U.S. Equities market has 13 lit exchanges and each exchange reports its top of book information to SIP (Securities Information Processor), which then publishes the NBBO (National Best Bid and Offer) to the public to consume. Many institutional users can also subscribe the direct feed from each exchange and build their own limit order book. The advantages of this approach are:

- it has smaller latency
- direct feed contains multiple price levels of the limit order book
- it includes odd-lot quotes

## Question
To make the illustration easier, an excerpt of the consolidated limit order book is simulated as follows:

```q
simQuote:{[venueList;nRow]
    priceList:30+0.01*til 10;
    prices:asc -3?priceList;
    venues:3?venueList;
    bidPrices:(count each venues)#'prices;
    bidExchanges:raze venues;
    (bidPrices;bidExchanges)
  };

simLob:{
    nRows:20;
    seed:-314159;
    openTime:`time$09:30;
    closeTime:`time$16:00;
    litVenues:`XNYS`ARCX`XCHI`XASE`XCIS`XNAS`XBOS`XPHL`BATS`BATY`EDGA`EDGX`IEXG;

    system "S ",string seed;
    times:asc closeTime&openTime+nRows?390*60*1000;
    nExchanges:2+nRows?(count litVenues)-8;
    bidVenues:{y?x}[litVenues;] each nExchanges;
    quotes:simQuote[bidVenues;] each til nRows;

    :([]time:times;bidPrices:raze each quotes[;0];bidExchanges:quotes[;1]);
  };
lob:simLob[];
```

The simulated data has three columns:

- ``time``: This is the timestamp of the limit order book snapshot.
- ``bidPrices``: It presents the multiple price levels on the buy side of the limit order book. Note that multiple exchange might quote at the same price level. The bid prices is already sorted descendingly.
- ``bidExchanges``: This columns corresponds to each values from ``bidPrices`` and show which exchange each bid price comes from. So ``bidExchanges`` and ``bidPrices`` have the same length element wise.

Find bid book on ``XNYS``, *i.e.* New York Stock Exchange.
