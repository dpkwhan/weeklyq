## Introduction
The first thing to do in most quantitative analysis in the electronic trading is to determine the data scope, which covers two aspects:

- the sample period, *i.e.* the start and end date/time of the data
- the cross sectional space, *i.e.* the universe of securities included in the analysis

A common approach to determine the security universe is to include the top ``n`` most actively traded symbols.


## Question
Assuming a ``trade`` table, which has three columns: ``date``, ``ticker`` and ``volume``, is simulated with the function ``simulateTrades`` defined below. This function generates ``500000`` trades for all week days in March 2020. The stock ticker is generated as three random letters. The column ``volume`` indicates how many shares are traded.

```q
getTradingDays:{
    firstDate:2020.03.01;
    lastDate:2020.03.31;
    dates:firstDate+til (lastDate-firstDate)+1;
    dates where not (dates mod 7) in 0 1
  };

simulateTrades:{[seed;nTrades]
    tradingDays:getTradingDays[];

    system "S ",string seed;
    dates:nTrades?tradingDays;

    system "S ",string seed;
    tickers:nTrades?`3;

    system "S ",string seed;
    volumes:100*nTrades?1+til 100;

    ([] date:dates;ticker:tickers;volume:volumes)
  };
trades:simulateTrades[-314159;5000000]
```

Find the top ``10`` symbols that are most actively traded (measured by total traded shares) on each day. The returned table should have ``220`` rows, *i.e.* ``10`` rows for each day and the following schema:

```q
topTradedSymbols:([]
  date:`date$();
  ticker:`symbol$();
  dailyVol:`long$()
)
```
