## Introduction
One frequently asked question in analyzing the behavior of a Smart Order Router (SOR) is how many time periods in which there is no open child orders on market and what are the start time and length of the no-slice period.

The following function ``genOrders`` simulates 5,000 child orders with order submission time and the time each order exits from the limit order book. It is assumed that the trading hours is from ``09:30`` to ``16:00`` and the parent order arrives exactly at ``09:30``.

```q
genOrders:{[nOrders;seed;openTime;closeTime]
    system "S ",string seed;
    submitTimes:asc closeTime&openTime+nOrders?390*60*1000;

    system "S ",string seed;
    exitTimes:closeTime&submitTimes+nOrders?60*1000;

    ([] orderId:1000+til nOrders;subT:submitTimes;exitT:exitTimes)
  };

openTime:`time$09:30;
closeTime:`time$16:00;
simOrders:genOrders[5000;-314159;openTime;closeTime];
```


## Question
We want to find all the time periods when there is no open child orders on market and how long each no-order
period lasts. The expected output is a table which should look like:

|  startTime   | periodLength |
|:------------:|:------------:|
| 09:30:00.000 | 00:00:17.080 |
| 10:25:57.802 | 00:00:04.595 |
| 10:29:43.843 | 00:00:00.676 |
| 11:08:07.079 | 00:00:05.682 |
| 12:30:43.199 | 00:00:08.152 |
| 15:29:06.359 | 00:00:08.213 |
