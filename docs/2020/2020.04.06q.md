## Introduction
Time in force (``TIF``) is a special instruction to indicate how long an order will remain live before it is executed, cancelled or expires. As a result, it gives the trader or the electronic algorithm a mechanism of controlling time for an order. A few selected ``TIF`` values include:

- ``Day``
- Good Till Cancel (``GTC``)
- At the Opening (``OPG``)
- Immediate Or Cancel (``IOC``)
- At the Close (``CLS``)

The [FIX][FIX] tag for time in force is ``59`` and additional details are available [here][FIXMate].


## Question
In algorithmic trading, a Smart Order Router (SOR) creates child orders and sends them to different exchanges for execution and each child order has an attribute called ``tif``. The function ``simOrdersTIF`` simulates a list of child orders with two attributes: ``time`` for order creation time and ``tif`` for the order's time in force.

```q
simOrdersTIF:{
    nOrders:10000;
    seed:-314159;
    openTime:`time$09:30;
    closeTime:`time$16:00;
    listTifs:`Day,20#`IOC;

    system "S ",string seed;
    times:asc closeTime&openTime+nOrders?390*60*1000;

    system "S ",string seed;
    tifs:nOrders?listTifs;
    ([] time:times;tif:tifs)
  };
orders:simOrdersTIF[];
```

Find all clusters of ``IOC`` orders and the cluster with the longest duration. A cluster of ``IOC`` orders is defined as a group of ``IOC`` orders created in a row. A cluster's duration is the time difference between the first order and the last order within a cluster.
