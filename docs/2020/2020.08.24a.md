## Answer

Two approaches are suggested:

**Method 1:** Use the [fill operator][Fill] (``^``). The typical use case is to replace nulls with non-null values. It can also join tables side by side.

```q
t1^t2
```

**Method 2:** Use [join operator][Join] (``,``). It can join atoms, lists, dictionaries and tables. When used together with [each][Each] (``'``), it can join tables column-wise.

```q
t1,'t2
```
