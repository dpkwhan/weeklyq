## Introduction
The question from last week mentions that time in force is tag 59 in FIX Protocol. The Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol is an electronic communication protocol widely used by today's financial trading systems and trading algorithms. Both order management system (OMS) and execution management system (EMS) use FIX to communicate order/execution information to different components electronically. All these incoming or outgoing FIX messages are logged with a key/value format. For example, the following log snippet

```q
35=D|22=RIC|48=MS.N|54=1|44=33.85|53=500|30=XNYS
```

might result from creating a new order sent to NYSE to buy 200 shares of Morgan Stanley at price 33.85. A good source of information on FIX message is [FIXimate][FIXimate].


## Question
Write a function to parse FIX message. This function returns a dictionary with tag number/value as the key/value of the dictionary.

```q
fixMsg:"35=D|22=RIC|48=MS.N|54=1|44=33.85|53=500|30=XNYS";
parseFixMsg[fixMsg]
```
