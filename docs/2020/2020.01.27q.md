## Introduction
NYSE TAQ data provides ``T+1`` trades reported to SIP and each trade has some basic information like timestamp, price, exchange, volume and trade qualifiers. The open/close auction trade on the primary exchange is marked by qualifiers ``0`` and ``6``, respectively. Define the daily volume as the total volume traded between the open/close auction trades on the primary, inclusively.

```q
genTrades:{[seed;nTrades]
    / Randomly generate each trade's timestamp
    system "S ",string seed;
    times:`time$09:28:00.000+nTrades?392*60*1000;

    / Randomly generate trade size
    system "S ",string seed;
    volumes:`long$100*1+nTrades?10;

    / Randomly generate each trade's sale condition
    system "S ",string seed;
    saleConditions:{x?`B`C`H`L`N`P`R`T`U`V`X`Z`7`4`5`8} each nTrades?3;

    / Create a table of trades
    trades:([] time:times;volume:volumes;saleCondition:saleConditions);

    / Add the open and close auction trades
    trades:trades upsert (`time$09:30:00.000+rand 60000;24700j;`O`X);
    trades:trades upsert (`time$16:00:00.000+rand 2000;53800j;enlist `6);

    / Sort the trades time by time
    `time xasc trades
  };
simTrades:genTrades[-314159;10000];
simTrades
```


## Question
To simplify the question, it is assumed that open/close auction trades are ALWAYS present. The function ``genTrades`` above simulates ``10,002`` trades. Note that each trade has up to two sale condition codes. Find the total volume between the two auction trades, inclusively.
