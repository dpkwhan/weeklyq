## Introduction
In many data analysis, we are interested in a subset of data sample, which meet certain conditions. This is represented by the well-known map-reduce paradigm. This programming model is very popular among modern programming languages. Kdb+/q also provides multiple functions to help us perform analysis on a subset of data.

## Question
The function ``simTrade`` simulates the volume and timestamp of trades for multiple different stocks in a week.

```q
simTrade:{
  n:100000;
  system "S -314159";
  :`date`sym xasc ([]date:n?2020.06.22+til 5;sym:n?`IBM`MSFT`AAPL`MS`GS`C`EDU;volume:n?10000);
  };
trades:simTrade[];
```

Find the largest trades for each stock on each day of the week.
