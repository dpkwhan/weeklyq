## Answer
First we compute the daily volume from the trade tick data and sort the volume in descending order for each date. Note that ``0!`` is used to remove the key from the table.

```q
dailyVolume:`date`dailyVol xdesc 0!select dailyVol:sum volume by date,ticker from trades;
```

Below four different approaches are provided to find the top ``10`` most actively trades symbols.

### Use ``fby``
Find the first ``10`` indices on each day and then filter out these rows.

```q
select from dailyVolume where ({x in 10#x};i) fby date
```

### Use ``sublist``
```q
ungroup select sublist[10] ticker,sublist[10] dailyVol by date from dailyVolume
```

### Use ``#``
Given ``sublist`` is implemented internally with take operator, using ``#`` directly is slightly faster than using ``sublist``.

```q
ungroup select 10#ticker,10#dailyVol by date from dailyVolume
```

### Use ``group``
```q
select from dailyVolume where i in raze 10#/:group date
```

## Remarks
The last approach using ``group`` is preferred due to two reasons:

- it runs fastest
- it is cleaner if multiple columns are present in the table
