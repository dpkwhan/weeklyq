## Answer
Below is the suggested answer to this question:

```q
times:update maxT:maxs exitT from simOrders;
times:update noOrderDur:subT-prev maxT from times;
times:update noOrderDur:subT-openTime from times where null noOrderDur;
select startTime:`time$subT-noOrderDur,periodLength:`time$noOrderDur from times where noOrderDur>0
```
Some detailed explanations on the suggested solution:

- Line 1: Find the running maximum time of order exiting from market.
- Line 2: Take the difference between the order submission time of each child order and the previous maximum exiting time. There is at least one open order on market if this time difference is negative.
- Line 3: Determine the period of no orders between market open and the time the first child order is sliced out.
- Line 4: Select the time period when the length of no-order period is positive.
