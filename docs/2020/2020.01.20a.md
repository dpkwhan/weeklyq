## Answer
The following two approaches are proposed:

**Method 1**

```q
raze {[s]
  f:$[s=`BUY;max;min];
  select from orders where side=s,price=(f;price) fby ([] poid;wid)
} each `BUY`SELL
```
In above implementation:

- Use ``raze`` to merge multiple conforming tables into a single table
- Conditional selection operator ($) is used to select which function to use based on the order side
- To group on multiple columns in a ``fby``, tabulate them in group

**Method 2**

```q
{
  data:`poid`wid`p xasc update p:?[side=`BUY;price;-1*price] from orders;
  data:delete p from data;
  0!select by poid,wid from data
}[]
```

A few notes about the second implementation:

- ``select by group from table`` gives you the last row in a group
- Use ``0!`` on to remove key(s) of a keyed table
