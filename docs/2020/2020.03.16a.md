## Answer
The following q script snippet is proposed.

```q
infile:hsym `$"C:/data/nasdaqlisted.txt";
nasdaqlisted:("SSSB JB ";enlist "|") 0:-1_read0 infile;
`symbol`securityName`marketCategory`isTestIssue`lotSize`isETF xcol nasdaqlisted
```

Some additional details on a few keywords used in the answer:

- [``hsym``][hsym] is used to create a file handle.
- [``read0``][read0] reads a text file and the last line is dropped with [``-1_``][drop].
- [``0:``][file_text] interprets a field-delimited list of strings as a matrix.
- Use a space to omit a field from the load if you don't want to load it.
- Use [``xcol``][xcol] to rename column name with space in it as discussed last week.
