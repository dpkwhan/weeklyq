## Answer
The child order count should increase by 1 at each order's submission time (``subT``) and decrease by 1 when the
order is removed from the market at exit time (``exitT``). Based on this reasoning logic, three tables are created:

- The first table contains one row, which has order count of zero to accommodate the time period from market open
    to the time when the first child order is created.
- The second table contains all new orders.
- The third table records all orders which are removed from market.

Along this line of thinking, the following implementation is suggested:

```q
initOrder:([] time:enlist openTime;nOpenOrders:enlist 0);
addOrder:select time:subTime,nOpenOrders:1 from simOrders;
removeOrder:select time:exitTime,nOpenOrders:-1 from simOrders;
orders:select time,sums nOpenOrders from `time xasc initOrder,addOrder,removeOrder;
select time,nOpenOrders from orders where differ nOpenOrders
```

The ``where differ nOpenOrders`` on the last line above is required to make sure the order count between two consecutive rows are different.
