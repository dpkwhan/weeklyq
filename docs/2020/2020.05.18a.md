## Answer
Below is the suggested answer:

```q
genNormalNumber:{
    pi:acos -1;
    $[x=2*n:x div 2;
      raze sqrt[-2*log n?1f]*/:(sin;cos)@\:(2*pi)*n?1f;
      -1_.z.s 1+x
    ]
  };
```

Explanations:

- Line 1 uses the [inverse trigonometric functions][ITF] to find $\pi$.
- Line 2 use an if-else ([$][cond]) to check whether the request number of random numbers is odd or even. Since the Box-Muller transformation always returns two random normal numbers, so a number has to be dropped if the input argument is an odd number. This is achieved by line 4. Note that [``.z.s``][self] is the function itself.
- Line 3 handles the case when input argument is an event number.
