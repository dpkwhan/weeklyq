## Answer
The following implementation of ``isLeapYear`` is borrowed from the official documentation side of Kx Systems.

```q
isLeapYear:{mod[;2] sum 0=x mod\: 4 100 400};
isLeapYear 1800 / 0b
isLeapYear 1900 / 0b
isLeapYear 2000 / 1b
isLeapYear 2020 / 1b
```

Detailed explanations on above implementation:

- For any given year ``x``, calculate the remainder of ``x`` divided by 4, 100 and 400, respectively.
```q
x mod\: 4 100 400
```
- This gives a boolean to indicate whether the year ``x`` is exactly divisible by 4, 100 and 400, respectively.
```q
0=x mod\: 4 100 400
```
- It shows ``x`` is exactly divisible by how many numbers among 4, 100 and 400. The result has a range of 0 to 3.
```q
sum 0=x mod\: 4 100 400
```
- ``mod[;2]`` is a function projection, *i.e.* converting a two-parameter function to a single-parameter function. Let's define ``s:sum 0=x mod\: 4 100 400`` and ``s`` has values from 0 to 3:

    * ``s=0``: It means that ``x`` is exactly divisible by none of 4, 100 and 400. In this case, ``mod[;2] s`` is 0.
    * ``s=1``: It means that ``x`` is only exactly divisible by 4. In this case, ``mod[;2] s`` is 1.
    * ``s=2``: It means that ``x`` is only exactly divisible by 4 and 100. In this case, ``mod[;2] s`` is 0.
    * ``s=3``: It means that ``x`` is exactly divisible by each of 4, 100 and 400. In this case, ``mod[;2] s`` is 1.

What a clever implementation!


## Alternatives
- Use vector operation and function application (the dot)
```q
isLeapYear1:{{x;y;z} . 0=x mod\: 100 400 4};
```

- This implementation is also very efficient but it is more like Python style
```q
isLeapYear2:{$[0=x mod 100;0=x mod 400;0=x mod 4]};
```

- Use vector operation and functional evaluation
```q
isLeapYear3:{eval enlist[$],0=x mod\: 100 400 4};
```

- Use logic operator
```q
isLeapYear4:{(0=x mod 400)| (0=x mod 4) & (0=x mod 100)};
```

## Performance

Use the following command to run each function 100000 times and record the running time:

```q
\t:100000 func each 1800 1900 2000 2020
```

|    Function     | Run Time (ms) |
|:---------------:|:-------------:|
| ``isLeapYear1`` |      348      |
| ``isLeapYear2`` |      390      |
| ``isLeapYear3`` |      398      |
| ``isLeapYear4`` |      563      |
| ``isLeapYear``  |      572      |
