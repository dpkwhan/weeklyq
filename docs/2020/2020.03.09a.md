## Answer
When selecting from a "problematic" table with space in column name or keyword as column name, the classical ``select ... from ...`` template does not work. We have two ways to deal with tables like this.

### Functional Select
The basic syntax of functional select is ``?[t;a;b;c]`` where:

- ``t``: a **t**able or table name
- ``a``: a dictionary of **a**ggregates
- ``b``: a dictionary of group **b**y
- ``c``: a dictionary of **c**onstraints

More details on functional select are [here][functional_forms] and [here][functional_sql].

```q
// Question 1
a:();
b:(enlist `orderType)!(enlist `$"order type");
c:(enlist `totalOrderQty)!(enlist (sum;`orderQty));
?[dataTbl;a;b;c]

// Question 2
a:(enlist (=;`$"order type";enlist `$"MID QUOTE"));
b:(enlist `sym)!(enlist `sym);
c:(enlist `totalOrderQty)!(enlist (sum;`orderQty));
?[dataTbl;a;b;c]
```

### Rename Columns
We can use ``xcol`` to rename the column names. Also note that we need to caste the string "MID QUOTE" to a symbol since it contains a space.

```q
// Question 1
select totalOrderQty:sum orderQty by orderType from `date`sym`orderType xcol dataTbl

// Question 2
select totalOrderQty:sum orderQty by sym from (
  `date`sym`orderType xcol dataTbl
) where orderType=`$"MID QUOTE"
```
