## Introduction

One frequently conducted analysis is to evaluate the relationship between a predicting variable (*e.g.* trade imbalance or quote imbalance) and the price return over a given look-ahead horizon $\Delta t$. For example, it is assumed that the price is $p_t$ at time $t$ and the price at $t+\Delta t$ is $p_{t+\Delta t}$. The price return over the time period $\Delta t$ is defined as
$$
r_{\Delta t} = \frac{p_{t+\Delta t} - p_t}{p_t}
$$

where the $\Delta t$ can vary from a few milliseconds to a few minutes, depending on the trading horizon your trading strategy is targeting.

## Question
The function ``simPrices`` simulates the price movement in the continuous trading session from ``09:30`` to ``16:00``.

```q
simPrices:{
  n:100000;
  system "S -314159";
  :([]time:asc 09:30+n?"n"$06:30;price:20+0.01*sums?[n?1.<0.5;-1;1]);
  };
prices:simPrices[];
```

For each row in the table, calculate the price return for horizon $\Delta t$, where $\Delta t$ is from 1 second to 5 seconds. So the resulting table has 7 columns:

| time                 | price | r1 | r2 | r3 | r4 | r5 |
|----------------------|-------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0D09:30:00.018905382 | 20.01 |    |    |    |    |    |

Your implementation should be generic enough to calculate the return for any number of horizons.
