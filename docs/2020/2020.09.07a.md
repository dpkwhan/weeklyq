## Answer

**Method 1:** Use [group][group]

```q
freq1:{#[;d] asc key d:count each group x};
```

**Method 2:** Use general apply with dyadic functions

```q
freq2:{@[x!count[x:asc distinct x]#0;x;+;1]};
```

Let's measure the performance of the two implementations:

```q
q)\ts:100000 freq1 nums
6577 369536
q)\ts:100000 freq2 nums
6843 262688
```

Method 2 runs slightly slower, but it takes significantly less memory.
