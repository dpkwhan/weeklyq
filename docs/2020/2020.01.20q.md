## Introduction
A set of child orders may be created in each evaluation cycle of a Smart Order Router (SOR) and these orders might be distributed among multiple price levels and even across different trading venues. The code below simulates this order creation process. In each evaluation cycle, five orders are generated, each of which has different price but has the save evaluation id. In this example, there are two parent orders: one for BUY and one for SELL.

```q
genCO:{[parentId;waveId;side]
    n:-5;

    system "S -314159";
    ids:`long$.z.N+n?1000;

    system "S -314159";
    prices:100+0.01*n?100;

    system "S -314159";
    sizes:100*1+n?10;

    ([] poid:parentId;wid:waveId;coid:ids;side:side;price:prices;size:sizes)
  };

genOrders:{
    buyOrders:raze {poid:`long$22:32:12.163;genCO[poid;x;`BUY]} each 101+til 20;
    sellOrders:raze {poid:`long$23:32:12.163;genCO[poid;x;`SELL]} each 101+til 20;
    buyOrders,sellOrders
  };

orders:genOrders[];
```


## Question
Find the most aggressive order, *i.e.* buy order with the highest price and sell order with the lowest price, within each evaluation cycle.
