## Answer
One implementation is suggested as follows. Note the use of inline assignment of variable ``n`` and ``xdm``. For curious reader, ``xdm`` means "**x** **d**e**m**eaned".

```q
wsdev:{[w;x]
    $[1>=n:sum w<>0;:0f;sqrt (n%n-1)*w wavg xdm*xdm:x-w wavg x]
  };
exec wsdev[notional;slippage] from perfData
```
