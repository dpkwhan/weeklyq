## Introduction
To gauge the effect of an event on market measures like volume and volatility, one simple way is to compare the measures before and after the event. To make a fair comparison, it makes sense to use the same number of trading days in the before and after data sample periods.

One of such events is stock split or reverse split. The most common split ratios are 2-for-1, which means that the stockholder will have two for every share held earlier. Reverse stock splits are the opposite transaction, where a company divides, instead of multiplies, the number of shares that stockholders own, raising the market price accordingly. Three key pieces of information about a stock split is:

- symbol: the trading identifier of the stock
- date: the effective date of the split
- split ratio: how many new shares one existing share is converted to

## Question
The function ``getSplitEvents`` simulates the stock split events which contain the trading identifier (``sym``), effective date (``date``) and the split ratio (``splitRatio``). The function ``getDailyVolume`` simulates the daily volume around the stock split effective date.

```q
getSplitEvents:{
    ([]sym:`ABC`DEF;date:2020.04.08 2020.04.13;splitRatio:0.2 10)
  };

getDailyVolume:{
    dates:2020.03.10+til 50;
    weekdays:dates where 1<dates mod 7;
    tradingDays:weekdays except 2020.04.10;
    nDays:count tradingDays;

    seed:-314159;
    system "S ",string seed;
    volABC:([]sym:nDays#`ABC;date:tradingDays;dailyVolume:nDays?200000+nDays?300000);
    volABC:update floor dailyVolume*0.2 from volABC where date<2020.04.08;

    system "S ",string seed;
    volDEF:([]sym:nDays#`DEF;date:tradingDays;dailyVolume:nDays?800000+nDays?300000);
    volDEF:update dailyVolume*10 from volDEF where date<2020.04.13;

    `date xasc volABC,volDEF
  };

events:getSplitEvents[];
volume:getDailyVolume[];
```

Find the 5-day Average Daily Volume (ADV) before and after the split event.
