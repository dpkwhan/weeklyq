## Introduction
One common operation on a dictionary is to add an new key to an existing dictionary. This operation looks quite easy
and straightforward at first sight, but there is a trap to fall into.


## Question
Suppose you have a dictionary ``d`` defined as follows:

```q
q) d:`firstName`lastName!`Tom`Jerry
```

How to add a new key ``age`` with value ``37`` to this dictionary? After adding the new key, the updated dictionary
should look like:

```q
q) d
firstName| Tom
lastName | Jerry
age      | 37
```
