## Answer
The first line finds the location where ``XNYS`` is present and the second line for the corresponding bid prices for ``XNYS``. Note the use of each both in this question and the same technique is used in the question from the previous week.

```q
lob:update nyseLoc:(where') `XNYS=bidExchanges from lob;
select time, bidPrices:bidPrices@' nyseLoc from lob
```

If you are a one liner, you can also do the following:

```q
select time, bidPrices:bidPrices@' (where') `XNYS=bidExchanges from lob
```
