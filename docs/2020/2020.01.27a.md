## Answer
We just need to find the timestamp of the two auction trades and then sum up volume of all trades between these two auction trades. This can be done like:

```q
auctionTimes:exec time from simTrades where any each saleCondition like\: "*[O6]*";
select sum volume from simTrades where time within auctionTimes
```

A few notable points worth mentioning:

- ``any each saleCondition like\: "*[O6]*"``: This ``where`` clause identifies the open/close auction trades.
- ``exec time from simTrades...``: Extract the open and close auction time as a list of two elements. The first element is the time for open auction trade and the second is for close auction trade.
