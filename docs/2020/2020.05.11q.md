## Introduction
The time weighted average is a commonly used measure in electronic trading. This measure assigns a smaller weight to a sudden and short-lived changes in the analytics you are interested in so that your analytics is not dramatically influenced by outliers.

## Question
The function ``simulateSpreadBps`` simulates the spread from ``09:30`` to ``16:00``, which returns a table with two columns: ``time`` and ``spreadBps``. The time is the effective time of the corresponding spread, which is in the unit of [basis point][BasisPoint].

```q
simulateSpreadBps:{[n]
    maxSpreadBps:10;
    cdf:0,sums {[n;p]n{(0,y*1-x)+x*y,0}[p]/1#1f}[maxSpreadBps-1;0.5];
    seed:-314159;
    mktOpenTime:"t"$09:30;
    mktCloseTime:"t"$16:00;
    system "S ",string seed;
    spreads:1+bin[cdf;n?1f]+n?1f;
    duration:ceiling raze 1?/:500&1%0.01*abs spreads-0.5*maxSpreadBps;
    dur:mktDur*durP:duration%mktDur:`long$mktCloseTime-mktOpenTime;
    times:mktOpenTime+`long$sums dur%sum durP;
    data:([]time:mktOpenTime,times;spreadBps:`float$maxSpreadBps,spreads);
    data:update dur:next[time]-time from data;
    data:update spreadBps:5*spreadBps from data where dur<00:00:00.050;
    select time,spreadBps from data
  };
spreads:simulateSpreadBps[100000];
```

Write a function ``calcTwaSpread`` to calculate the time weighted average spread for any given time period. The expected time weighted average spread between ``10:31`` and ``14:35`` is about ``6.52`` bps, instead, the simple average spread is around ``11`` bps.

```q
calcTwaSpread[spreads;10:31;14:35] / 6.52
```
