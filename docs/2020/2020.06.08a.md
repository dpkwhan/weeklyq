## Answer
The suggested answer is as follows:

```q
futRet:(,'/) {[d;i]
  t:prices`time;
  w:(t;t+"v"$i);
  r:wj[w;`time;d;(d;({p0:first x;p1:last x;-1+p1%p0};`price))];
  ?[r;();0b;enlist[`$"r",string i]!enlist `price]
  }[prices;] each 1+til 5;
prices,'futRet
```

Some explanations on the implementation:

- ``{[d;i] ...}[prices;]`` defines an anonymous unary function using function projection over a binary function. The original binary function takes two arguments: the first argument is a table, which has at least two columns like ``time`` and ``price`` and the second argument is the prediction horizon in the unit of seconds.
- ``(,'/)`` joins all tables side by side.
- ``w:(t;t+"v"$i);`` defines a time window for ``wj``.
- ``(d;({p0:first x;p1:last x;-1+p1%p0};`price))`` calculates the price return for a given time window. Note that the column name is still ``price``.
- Line 5 renames ``price`` to ``ri``, where ``i`` is an integer from 1 to 5.
- The last line joins the price return with original table side by side.
