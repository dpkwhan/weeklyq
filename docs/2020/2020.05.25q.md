## Introduction
Factorial is one of most common mathematical concepts, which is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. It is denoted mathematically as,

$$n! = n \times (n-1) \times (n-2) \times \cdot\cdot\cdot \times 1$$

This is commonly seen in combinations and permutations or Taylor series.

## Question
Implement a function ``factorial`` to calculate the factorial of a given integer. Return zero if the input integer is negative. Try your best to provide multiple implementations.
